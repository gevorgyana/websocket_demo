use this page to get guides on how to
write the client app; the java websocket api
is very simple and uses annotated method;
therefore, simply need to follow the guides.

first step is porting to gradle the project
taht Gleb has. (only the server part)

second step is implementing simple (maybe even use
a library of some kind) collision on two objects;

0) handshakes
1) server is listening to client
2) client sends data (the coords and masses, and
acceleration)
3) from now on: the server keeps calculating the
positions of the balls with the help of some
formula, and the cliens keeps getting the coordinates
from the server and getting them plotted (first do not
use any graphics library, then use it). no idea yet what
the graphics library should look like.

the funny thing is that Tomcat is
not even necessary here. WebSockets
can use used with Spring. They can
also be used with bare java
exetensions. I am now trying to
simply inlcude the java extensions
and see how gradle resolves them.
Here is the link to the guide that
does it the same way. https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/10/22/create-websocket-server-java-api-dr
