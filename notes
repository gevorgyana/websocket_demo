use this page to get guides on how to
write the client app; the java websocket api
is very simple and uses annotated method;
therefore, simply need to follow the guides.

first step is porting to gradle the project
taht Gleb has. (only the server part)

second step is implementing simple (maybe even use
a library of some kind) collision on two objects;

0) handshakes
1) server is listening to client
2) client sends data (the coords and masses, and
acceleration)
3) from now on: the server keeps calculating the
positions of the balls with the help of some
formula, and the cliens keeps getting the coordinates
from the server and getting them plotted (first do not
use any graphics library, then use it). no idea yet what
the graphics library should look like.
